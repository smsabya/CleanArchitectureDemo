**1. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**

Scope: Focuses only on the presentation layer (UI & logic separation).
Layers in MVVM

â€¢	View (UI - Activity/Fragment)

      o	Displays data & observes changes.
      o	Forwards user actions to ViewModel.

â€¢	ViewModel

      o	Holds UI logic and state.
      o	Exposes LiveData/StateFlow for the View to observe.
      o	Calls the Repository for data but does not know data source details.

â€¢	Model (Repository)

      o	Fetches and provides data (from API, Database, or Cache).
      o	Typically interfaces with a Repository to handle data logic.

ðŸ“Œ MVVM ensures UI logic is kept separate but does not enforce strict domain separation.

**2. Clean Architecture**

Scope: Focuses on the entire application structure, ensuring better separation of concerns and testability.
Layers in Clean Architecture

Presentation Layer (UI)

     o	Contains View (Activity/Fragment) + ViewModel
     o	Uses MVVM for state management.
Domain Layer (Business Logic)

     o	Contains Use Cases (Interactors) which execute business logic.
     o	Uses Repository Interface (doesnâ€™t depend on data sources).
     o	Does not contain Android dependencies (pure Kotlin).
Data Layer (Repositories & Data Sources)

     o	Implements the Repository Interface.
     o	Communicates with APIs, Databases, Local Storage.
     o	Converts raw data to domain models.

ðŸ“Œ Clean Architecture enforces strict layer separation, making testing easier and reducing coupling.

When to Use?

â€¢	Use MVVM when:
o	You only need UI state management.
o	Your app is small or medium-sized.

â€¢	Use Clean Architecture when:
o	You want scalability, flexibility, and better testability.
o	Your app has complex business logic.

Conclusion
MVVM is a subset of Clean Architecture, meaning MVVM is used in Clean Architectureâ€™s Presentation Layer. Clean Architecture enforces better separation of concerns across the entire application, not just UI.
